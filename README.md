# SEO Friendly Type Animation

### Prerequisites

```
anime.js
```

### Example
You can find an example here: https://jaivinwylde.github.io/seo-friendly-typed-animation/

### How To Use

Write HTML like this:

```html
<h1>This is <span class="type" data-words="a test., an experiment., a trial., an exercise.">a test.</span></h1>
```

The words in the data-words attribute will be what is typed out in the animation. You can make the **actual text** of the tag something **important for your SEO**.

### Styling

You can style the type class's ::after pseudo element to change the look of the cursor. You can also edit the timing variables and easing function in the javascript.
